In 1990, Kohnert proposed a combinatorial model for Schubert polynomials, which Assaf recently proved is in bijection with Bergeron and Billey's reduced pipe dreams. Building on this, Ross and Yong offered a conjecture for a K-Kohnert's rule for Grothendieck polynomials, which are the K-theoretic analog of Schubert polynomials and can be represented by non-reduced pipe dreams. In this paper, we review each of these models and offer an adaptation of Assaf's bijection for non-reduced pipe dreams and K-Kohnert diagrams.
